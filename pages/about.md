## About the Collection

This collection is a collaborative effort by students and faculty from various departments at the University of Colorado Boulder to design and maintain a Material Library. A materials library is a browsing collection of physical samples, such as biocomposites, natural and engineered stone, textiles, and other design materials. These collections support teaching, research and creative work by providing tactile access to a wide range of materials, often tailored to the needs of specific disciplines or academic programs. 

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The repository currently features 13 objects from the University of Colorado Boulder's [ENVD Material Library](https://live-ucbdev-environmental-design-material-library.pantheonsite.io/).
